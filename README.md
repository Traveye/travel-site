## Description 

We created this project because it is easy to forget the memories and specifics that happen on a trip. So we created a application that allows user to pick any place on a map and journal their experiences on the trip. After signing in you can click the map to drop a pin or search for a specific location to create a new pin. Then you will be able to open a new trip journal from the pin and enter in all of your memories.
