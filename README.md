## Description 

We created this project because it is easy to forget the memories and specifics that happen on a trip. So we created a application that allows user to pick any place on a map and journal their experiences on the trip. We wanted to make sure the that users can have multiple different trips with journal entries and we solved that by letting each pin on the map contain link to that specific trip and journal information.
